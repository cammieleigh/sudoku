# Overview

The game that I wrote was a sudoku game (albeit not not totally working). It is the same rules and set up as a traditional game of sudoku. As the player you will have been given a board, as well as a list of numbers. You use your mouse to drag and drop the numbers in the space that you want.

I wanted to write this game both because I love sudoku and I wanted to become more familiar with Python as well as Python arcade.

# Development Environment

I used VS code to create this game, and used the python + pylance extension as the language for the game. I used python arcade to create the game (although looking back pygame may have been better as it has more resources).

# Future Work

-I need to have at least 9 of each number so that the player has enough numbers to complete the game
-I would like to have it randomly create boards as opposed to a hard-coded board
-I would like to have an option where a player can be warned they made a mistake (if they want it)
